    <h2 class="section_head gen_spac">Education</h2>
      <p class="gen_spac font">Currently enrolled at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in the "Computer Software and Engineering Technology" major. This is a two year program focused on the facets of software development in both the front and back-end areas.
      </p>
      <p class="gen_spac font">My previous education includes one year at Grantham University, where I attended all-online classes in pursuit of a criminal justice degree. After I completed the classes, I became aware that CJ was not the field I was truly interested in.

    <h2 class="section_head gen_spac">Skills</h2>
    <p class="gen_spac font">Two of the skills I've focused on over the past few years, and spent time sharpening, are team-focused operation and attention to detail. These allow me to integrate quickly into new teams and work efficiently with team-members.
    </p>
    <p class="gen_spac font">Throughout the times where I worked alone, or with little supervision, I developed two skills critical to accomplishing work by oneself. Being self-driven, and being able to manage time effectively. Combined, these skills are a major factor in the completion of tasks that require timeliness and efficiency.

    <h2 class="section_head gen_spac">Work Experience</h2>
    <div>
    <p class="gen_spac font">My most recently held job (if you could call it that) is also my longest-held position. As a Human Resources Sergeant in the United States Army Reserve, it is my responsibility to handle administrative functions at the battalion level, and to lead junior-enlisted Soldiers in the training and accomplishment of administrative tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="gen_spac font">This position has had me serve in many environments, but my familiarity with the "office" type of work-setting has never changed. I am well versed in the ins and outs of office politics, and can navigate interpersonal conflicts without unnecessary stress or distraction.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="gen_spac font">My last employer was the WebstaurantStore.com, where I began as an Order Packer. I quickly climbed through the roles, becoming an Order Picker, and being selected as the Transfer Picker. This position worked nearly autonomously, relying upon my own self-drive and time management to accomplish my daily tasks by the end of the shift.
    </p>
    <p class="gen_spac font">The employer before the WebstaurantStore was GardaWorld Inc. A company you may have seen in passing, as one of their armored trucks passed by on the way to a bank or supermarket. As a Vault Operator, I was responsible for the accountability and movement of monetary deposits between Clients, Messengers, and GardaWorld.

    <h2 class="section_head gen_spac">Volunteer Experience</h2>
    <p class="gen_spac font">Over the length of five months in 2009, I volunteered as a mentor at the Special Olympics Aquatic Division in Reading. This opportunity enabled me to work and meet some truly amazing individuals while training them for swim meets.

    <h2 class="section_head gen_spac">Hobbies</h2>
    <p class="cent_cont gen_spac font">I've been known to occasionally enjoy a good hike, and consistently seek out historical sightseeing with my fiancee.
    </p>
    <p class="cent_cont gen_spac font">Hobbies I enjoy that are more solo are stargazing, a good round of golf, and graphic design. Additionally, sitting down with my Xbox is a good way to relieve stress and have fun.
